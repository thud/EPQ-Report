\section{Blockchain Architecture}
The following table shows all the data types which are to be used for the platform.
\begin{table}[h]

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{address}
A Bim address is made by taking the 256-bit \textit{x} component of a user's public key and appending a byte to indicate whether the \textit{y} component is odd or even.
\[ \textit{address} = \textit{x component of public key} + \textit{odd\_or\_even} \]
where
\[\textit{odd\_or\_even} = 
\begin{cases}
    \texttt{00}_{16} &\textit{y component is even,} \\[6pt]
    \texttt{FF}_{16} &\textit{y component is odd.}
\end{cases}
\]

\subsection{tx}
The following table shows the structure of a \textbf{tx} (message transaction).
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|p{1.3cm}|p{3cm}|p{5.5cm}|}
\hline
\rowcolor{tblgrey}
Data Type   & Field       & Description\\ \hline
char[\hspace{0.05cm}]    & version     & Transaction data format version.                          \\ \hline

uint\_8[\hspace{0.05cm}]  & encrypted\_payload & Encrypted payload. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{chat\_id} (ChatID) is a cryptographically secure 256-bit random number. This must be exchanged between users before they can communicate properly.
    \item \textit{lock\_time} is the first block in which this transaction can be included.
    \item \textit{nonce} is a random value incremented until the tx\_id is below a target value.
    \item \textit{tsdc} is the `transaction-specific difficulty constant (network minimum 1000).
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\paragraph{Encrypting and Decrypting a tx}
Encryption on this platform is largely asymmetric; the \textit{secp256k1} curve is used for all elliptic curve cryptography (same parameters as Bitcoin).
The steps to \textbf{encrypt} are as follows (identical to Bitmessage):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The destination public key is called $K$.
    \item Generate 16 random bytes using a cryptographically secure random number generator. Call them \textit{iv}.
    \item Generate a new random EC key pair with private key called $r$ and public key called $R$.
    \item Do an EC point multiply with public key $K$ and private key $r$. This gives you public key $P$.
    \item Use the $x$ component of public key $P$ and calculate the \textbf{SHA512} hash $H$.
    \item The first 32 bytes of $H$ are called \textit{key\_e} and the last 32 bytes are called \textit{key\_m}.
    \item Pad the input text\footnote{This just refers to the input payload (ie. the fields that will later become \textit{encrypted\_payload}) in bytes.} to a multiple of 16 bytes, in accordance to PKCS7.
    \item Encrypt the data with \textbf{AES-256-CBC}, using \textit{iv} as initialization vector, \textit{key\_e} as encryption key and the padded input text as payload. Call the output \textit{cipher\_text}.
    \item Calculate a 32 byte MAC with \textbf{HMACSHA256}, using \textit{key\_m} as salt and \textit{iv} + $R$ + \textit{cipher\_text} as data. Call the output \textit{mac}.
\end{enumerate}
Thus the steps to \textbf{decrypt} are as follows (again identical to Bitmessage):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The private key used to decrypt is called $k$.
    \item Do an EC point multiply with private key $k$ and public key $R$. This gives you public key $P$.
    \item Use the $x$ component of public key $P$ and calculate the \textbf{SHA512} hash $H$.
    \item The first 32 bytes of $H$ are called \textit{key\_e} and the last 32 bytes are called \textit{key\_m}.
    \item Calculate MAC' with \textbf{HMACSHA256}, using \textit{key\_m} as salt and \textit{iv} + $R$ + \textit{cipher\_text} as data.
    \item Compare MAC with MAC'. If not equal, decryption will fail.
    \item Decrypt the cipher text with \textbf{AES-256-CBC}, using \textit{iv} as initialization vector, \textit{key\_e} as decryption key and the \textit{cipher\_text} as payload. The output is the padded input text.
\end{enumerate}

Here, the \textit{cipher\_text} is the \textit{encrypted\_payload}.

\paragraph{Proof-of-Work}
The target value for a transaction's proof-of-work is calculated as follows.
\[\textit{target} = \dfrac{2^{64}}{\textit{tsdc} \times \left(\textit{payloadLength} + \textit{payloadExtraBytes}\right)}\]
\textit{payloadExtraBytes} is set to 1000 as a network minimum. Its purpose is to increase the difficulty of small messages. \textit{payloadLength} refers to the length in bytes of \textit{encrypted\_payload}.

To actually compute proof-of-work for a tx, find \[\textit{result} = H(H(\textit{nonce} + \textit{encrypted\_payload}))\] and repeat until \textit{result} is below the \textit{target} value.

The use of proof of work on each transaction increases the computational cost for a node to spam the network.

\section{Network}
This platform uses a decentralised peer-to-peer network of nodes who relay information between each other. All communication is done over \textbf{TCP} (Transmission Control Protocol).

The default port for use of this platform's network protocol is \textbf{8855}.

The `ip\_addr' type has to be defined for the network protocol. This consists of the following structure.
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|p{2.2cm}|p{3cm}|p{5.5cm}|}
\hline
\rowcolor{tblgrey}
Data Type   & Field       & Description\\ \hline

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{magic} is the magic value of the network being used (\texttt{DDE6AE4C}$_{16}$ and \\ \texttt{CF713BF3}$_{16}$ for main and test networks respectively);
    \item \textit{command} indicates the type of message to be sent (ie. 0 = \textit{text}, 1 = \textit{acknowledgement}, ...);
    \item \textit{checksum} is the first four bytes of $H(request\_payload)$ \\
    ($H \coloneqq$ \texttt{SHA256} hash function);
    \item \textit{request\_payload} is the main request itself.
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\subsection{request\_payload}
A \textbf{request\_payload} can be any of the following types.

\begin{center}
    \large \textit{version}
\end{center}
The \textbf{version} request is how all communications on the network are initiated. Each node sends a `version' request to the other, who returns with a `verack'.
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|p{1.5cm}|p{2.5cm}|p{5.5cm}|}
\hline
\rowcolor{tblgrey}
Data Type   & Field       & Description\\ \hline
uint\_8     & version     & Version of platform being used.                          \\ \hline
uint\_64    & nonce       & Random nonce used to detect connections to self.                   \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{center}
    \large \textit{verack}
\end{center}
The \textbf{verack} request is made in response to a `version' request. It contains no fields and thus the payload is empty.

\begin{center}
    \large \textit{addr}
\end{center}
The \textbf{addr} request is made when a node wants to discover new nodes on the network. This request should be made in most interactions between two nodes in order to keep the network online.
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|p{1.5cm}|p{2.5cm}|p{5.5cm}|}
\hline
\rowcolor{tblgrey}
Data Type   & Field       & Description\\ \hline
ip\_addr[\hspace{0.05cm}] & addr\_l       & Array of shared node addresses. (max 1000)                               \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{center}
    \large \textit{inv}
\end{center}
The \textbf{inv} request is sent once `verack's have been exchanged. This is so that each node knows the exact data available to them.

\begin{center}
    \large \textit{get\_newtx}
\end{center}
The \textbf{get\_newtx} request is sent in order to ask for all transactions that have yet to be included in the blockchain. It contains no fields; thus the payload is empty. Non-mining nodes will never need to send this request but they may receive a `get\_newtx' request.

\begin{center}
    \large \textit{newtx}
\end{center}
The \textbf{newtx} request is sent in response to a `get\_newtx' request. It contains one field: a list of transactions.
